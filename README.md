# Zen

Distraction free writing for Atom.

Toggle with `cmd-ctrl-z` on OS X or by adding `shift` to your platform's
fullscreen command:
- `cmd-ctrl-shift-F` on OSX
- `shift-F11` on Windows and Linux.

Settings:
- Width
- Tabs can all be hidden, or all except the active tab
- Optional soft wrap
- Keep the [word count](https://atom.io/packages/wordcount) visible

Note that settings are not available until the package has been activated, due to [a shortcoming in core](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/356). Also, if you change themes, you might need to reload Atom for the colors to be applied correctly to all packages including Zen.
